# Iris Species Classification and Analysis Using Decision Tree and K-Nearest Neighbors

## Overview
This project focuses on the classification of iris flower species using machine learning models. We use the famous "Iris" dataset, which contains measurements of various features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width) for three species of iris flowers: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. The goal is to explore, analyze, and classify these species with high accuracy using Decision Tree and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithms.

## Project Structure
The notebook is structured as follows:
1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing**: Load the dataset, handle any missing values, and prepare it for analysis.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualize relationships between features and analyze patterns to gain insights into the data.
3. **Modeling and Classification**:
   - **Decision Tree Classifier**: Build, train, and evaluate a Decision Tree model for iris species classification.
   - **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: Implement and test the KNN algorithm to classify the iris species.
4. **Evaluation and Comparison**: Compare the performance of both models using metrics like accuracy.

## Installation
To run this project, you will need Python and several libraries. Install the required packages as follows:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```


## Usage Instructions
1. **Clone the repository** and open the notebook using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
2. **Run each cell sequentially** to:
   - Load and preprocess the dataset.
   - Visualize feature relationships using Seaborn and Matplotlib for insightful patterns.
   - Train and evaluate machine learning models (Decision Tree and KNN) for accurate classification of iris species.

## Project Results
This analysis shows that both the Decision Tree and K-Nearest Neighbors classifiers achieve high accuracy in identifying iris species, with a comparative evaluation of each modelâ€™s performance.
